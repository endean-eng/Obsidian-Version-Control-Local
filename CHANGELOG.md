**Version: 2.0.0 (October 2026) — Local & Hardened Edition**

#### Security & Air-Gap Hardening
* **100% Local Execution (Zero Network Egress):** Removed all remote `fetch` calls, external `shields.io` badge requests, and remote changelog polling. Vault data and metadata have zero external network pathways.

#### Bug Fixes & Enhancements
* **Fixed UTF-8 / CJK Garbled Text (#50):** Enforced exact `byteOffset` / `byteLength` slicing across all Web Worker `ArrayBuffer` transfers and `fflate` compression streams.
* **Fixed Legacy & Existing Edit History Loading (#43 / #44):** Added automatic GZIP/ZLIB header magic-byte detection and synchronous fallback decompression for legacy `.vctrl` archives.
* **Fixed Tab Scrolling Interference (#51):** Added `{ preventScroll: true }` to all delayed focus hooks and scoped CSS variables.
* **Prompt for Version Name on Creation (#52):** Added an instant naming modal when saving versions via hotkey/Command Palette.
* **Protected & Recoverable Deleted Note Histories (#49):** Deleting a note no longer wipes its version history automatically. Added a new Command Palette tool (`Restore version from deleted / orphaned notes`) to browse and recover deleted notes.

**Version: 1.9.36**

#### ✨ New Features

* **Automatic Data Persistence:** Edit history now supports automatic synchronization across devices.
    * Previously, data was restricted to `indexedDB`, but it is now stored in `.vctrl` extension files, allowing for seamless syncing.
    * The process runs automatically in the background without requiring user intervention.
    * Edit history data is located at `.versiondb` (or your custom location) `/vc-id/branches/*`.
    
#### 🔍 Technical Note: Inspecting `.vctrl` Files

If you wish to manually inspect the version control files, you can follow these steps:
1. Change the file extension from `.vctrl` to `.zip` and extract it.
2. Inside, you will find a `manifest.json`, `data.json`, and a `blobs` folder.
3. In the `blobs` folder, change the `.bin` extensions to `.zip` and extract them to reveal extension-less files.
4. Add the `.md` extension to these files to make them readable.

#### 🎨 Improvements & UX

#### ⚠️ Important Notice

* **Potential Data Inconsistency Fix:** This release includes necessary changes for future stability, which might result in **SOME data loss** for a small number of users. We deeply apologize for this inconvenience. This is crucial for addressing and removing existing inconsistencies that could have led to more significant data loss in the future.
* **Ignorable Errors:** You may safely **ignore all file rename errors** you encounter. These are non-critical, false positives caused by concurrent operations and do not affect the functionality or integrity of your data.

***

**Version: 1.9.33**

#### ✨ New Features

* **Compression Feature:** Added an optional compression feature. When enabled, it ensures all version history files are compressed before being written to disk, which helps limit file size.
* **Manual Decompression Note:** If you want to use the version file without the plugin, you can change the version file's `.md` extension to `.gz`, extract the file, rename the extracted file by adding the `.md` extension, and then open it.

***

**Version: 1.9.32**

#### ✨ New Features

* **Edit History (Per Branch):** Introducing passive, automatic snapshots of every change you make.
    * There are now two types of history: **Version History** (for intentional, milestone saves) and **Edit History** (for granular, automatic changes).
    * Edit History conserves resources by saving only highly compressed diffs (like Git) between changes, while Version History continues to save the full content.
    * Currently, Edit History data is stored solely in IndexedDB (request a feature for disk storage).
    * **Switching Views:** Simply click on the "Version History" header text (at the top left corner of the version control view in the right sidebar) to toggle between "Version History" and "Edit History."

* **Early Stable Release:** This is an early stable release of the Edit History feature. While major problems are unlikely (i hope), minor inconsistencies are possible, please open an issue if you encounter any inconsistencies. Your feedback is highly valued!

    *   Each branch saves its own content, cursor position, and history, allowing you to experiment freely without fear of messing up your primary version.
    *   This is a power-user feature. For regular use, you can continue working on the default `main` branch with no changes to your workflow.
